        "details": "I built this project to get an overview of my home server's containers without having to log in via SSH. \n\nThe system consists of two main components: \n\n1. A Backend (Python/Flask) that communicates with the Docker Socket to retrieve the status of all containers, sorts containers with errors to the top, and exposes the data via a JSON API.\n\n2. An ESP8266 + screen that fetches and visualizes the data and also functions as a web server. \n\nOne of the biggest technical challenges was the limited RAM on the ESP8266. To prevent crashes when handling large JSON objects and graphics simultaneously, I implemented 'Page Buffer' rendering via the U8g2 library and dynamic memory allocation. It changes pages automatically, but you can also click the flash button to scroll between the pages yourself. \n\nI also implemented better sorting of containers so that down-containers are displayed first, as well as an automatic night mode that dims the screen based on NTP time synchronization. \nI also made a web panel that runs directly on the ESP to easily see the same thing via a web browser."
